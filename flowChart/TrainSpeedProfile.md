***Run the Simulation***

***Operation Philosophy***

The train will be one of three modes

- **Acceleration mode**: The train accelerates to it's maximum speed
- **Coasting**: Tractive effort is withdrawn and the train travels on it's own inertia. It slows due to friction
- **Braking**: The train brakes on it's braking power

***Explanation***

The average speed of a metro train can be calculated by analyzing the phases of the journey: acceleration, cruising at max speed, and braking.

To derive the average speed, we can use the following logic:

1. **Acceleration Phase**: The train accelerates from 0 to maximum speed.
2. **Cruising Phase**: The train maintains the maximum speed until it begins braking.
3. **Coasting Phase**: The train's speed gradually decreases due to the deceleration caused by friction, which depends on the current speed.
4. **Braking Phase**: The train decelerates to 0 at the destination.

The total distance covered during acceleration and braking can be split up.

$\large t_a = \frac{m}{a}$, 

$\large t_b = \frac{m}{b}$



```python

```

To account for friction during the cruising (now coasting) phase, we can incorporate the train resistance equation. The coasting phase will involve the train gradually decelerating due to the resistance force. The train resistance (friction) is commonly modeled using a quadratic or linear function of speed, such as:

$\large
F_r = A + Bv + Cv^2
$

Where:
- $ F_r $ is the total resistance (in Newtons).
- $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ are coefficients for the train resistance (typically dependent on the type of train).
- $ v $ is the train's velocity during coasting.

**Hundai Rotem** for LTMRHL

$ \large R = 14.01 + 0.264 \times V + 0.00191 \times V^2 $

- R: Train Resistance in N/Ton
- V: Train Speed in Km/h

$\huge R = \frac{500}{r} $

- R: Curve Resistance in N/Ton
- r: Curve Radius in m

The equation for motion during the coasting phase will now take into account this resistance. The deceleration due to resistance can be computed using:

$\huge
a_{\text{coast}} = -\frac{F_r}{m_{\text{train}}}
$

Where:
- $ a_{\text{coast}} $ is the deceleration during coasting.
- $ m_{\text{train}} $ is the mass of the train.



```python

```

Introducing curve and gradient resistance into the train's journey adds new complexities to the coasting and cruising phases. Here's how we'll incorporate these factors:

#### Curve Resistance:
- **Curve Resistance** occurs due to the curvature of the track. For a given curve, the additional resistance is calculated as:

$\huge
  R_{\text{curve}} = \frac{600}{\text{radius of the curve in meters}} 
$

#### Gradient Resistance:
- **Gradient Resistance** is the resistance caused by an incline or decline in the track. For a 1 in 100 gradient, the resistance is:

$\huge
  R_{\text{gradient}} = 9.81 \times \frac{1}{100} \times \text{mass of the train (in kg)}
$



```python

```

The line of code:

```python
t_total = np.sqrt(2 * d / (a + b))
```

is used to calculate the total time required for the train to travel a given distance `d` if the train does not reach its maximum speed during acceleration or braking.

### Breakdown:

- `d`: The total distance to be traveled.
- `a`: The acceleration rate (in meters per second squared, m/sÂ²).
- `b`: The braking rate (in meters per second squared, m/sÂ²).

### Explanation:

This line is derived from the following scenario:

- If the train does not reach the maximum speed during the journey, the motion is purely controlled by the acceleration and braking phases.
- The train first accelerates at rate `a` and then decelerates (brakes) at rate `b` to stop at the destination. In this situation, the train never reaches its cruising (maximum) speed.

In such a case, the total time `t_total` required to travel the distance `d` can be calculated by using a simplified kinematic equation that accounts for both acceleration and braking phases.

1. **Kinematic equation for displacement (ignoring maximum speed)**:
   The total distance traveled under constant acceleration and braking is given by:

   
   $\huge
   d = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{accel}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} b t_{\text{brake}}^2
   $

   Since the train accelerates and brakes symmetrically (one phase follows the other), the total time can be treated as a function of both `a` and `b`. For simplicity, we assume:

   
   $\huge
   d = \frac{1}{2} (a + b) t_{\text{total}}^2
   $

3. **Rearranging the equation** to solve for `t_total`:

4. 
   $\huge
   t_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a + b}}
  $

This equation assumes that the entire journey is a combination of acceleration and braking, with no constant-speed coasting phase. 

### Key Points:
- The `t_total` calculation is only valid when the train never reaches the maximum speed.
- The formula simplifies the process by treating the acceleration and braking phases together, assuming symmetrical motion. The distance is split between the acceleration and braking phases.



```python

```

**Coasting Phase Logic**:

- The speed is  updated at each time step during the coasting phase.
- **Gradual Speed Reduction**: The speed is reduced continuously in the coasting phase as the train slows down due to friction.
- The velocity decreases based on the deceleration due to friction, which is computed using the train resistance equation at each time step.
- During this phase, if the speed falls below $ 0.9 Ã ð $, the train will re-accelerate until it reaches the maximum speed again  or until the segment distance is covered.
- We'll use a simple loop to check the speed at each time step during the coasting phase. If it drops below the threshold, acceleration is reapplied until the train returns to its maximum speed.


Additionaly in function: calculate_average_speed_with_reacceleration, the function now calculates how many times re-acceleration is triggered during the coasting phase and integrates that into the overall timing and speed profile.


```python

```

1. **Curve and Gradient Handling**: Instead of assigning a single curve or gradient to a section, we'll calculate their effects cumulatively if there are overlapping curves or gradients.

2. **Resistance Calculations**: The calculate_cumulative_resistance() function computes the total resistances from all applicable curves and gradients at each segment.


```python

```

The formula $P_{\text{required}} = R_{\text{total}} \times v $ is used to calculate the **power required** by a train to overcome various resistances while it is in motion. 

- **Power in Physics**:
  
   $
   P = F \times v
  $
  
   Where:
   - $ P $ is power,
   - $ F $ is the force (in this case, the total resistance),
   - $ v $ is the velocity (speed of the train).


### Example:

- If a train is moving at a speed of 20 m/s and the total resistance it encounters is 300 N, the power required to maintain that speed would be calculated as follows:
  
  $
  P_{\text{required}} = R_{\text{total}} \times v = 300 \, \text{N} \times 20 \, \text{m/s} = 6000 \, \text{W} 
  $

This means the train needs to produce at least 6000 watts (6 Kw) of power to maintain that speed against the resistance. If the power available from the train's motor is less than this, it will start to decelerate.


```python

```
