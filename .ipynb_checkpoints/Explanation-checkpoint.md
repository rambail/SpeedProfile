The line of code:

```python
t_total = np.sqrt(2 * d / (a + b))
```

is used to calculate the total time required for the train to travel a given distance `d` if the train does not reach its maximum speed during acceleration or braking.

### Breakdown:

- `d`: The total distance to be traveled.
- `a`: The acceleration rate (in meters per second squared, m/s²).
- `b`: The braking rate (in meters per second squared, m/s²).

### Explanation:

This line is derived from the following scenario:

- If the train does not reach the maximum speed during the journey, the motion is purely controlled by the acceleration and braking phases.
- The train first accelerates at rate `a` and then decelerates (brakes) at rate `b` to stop at the destination. In this situation, the train never reaches its cruising (maximum) speed.

In such a case, the total time `t_total` required to travel the distance `d` can be calculated by using a simplified kinematic equation that accounts for both acceleration and braking phases.

1. **Kinematic equation for displacement (ignoring maximum speed)**:
   The total distance traveled under constant acceleration and braking is given by:
   \[
   d = \frac{1}{2} a t_{\text{accel}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} b t_{\text{brake}}^2
   \]

   Since the train accelerates and brakes symmetrically (one phase follows the other), the total time can be treated as a function of both `a` and `b`. For simplicity, we assume:
   \[
   d = \frac{1}{2} (a + b) t_{\text{total}}^2
   \]

2. **Rearranging the equation** to solve for `t_total`:
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{a + b}}
   \]

This equation assumes that the entire journey is a combination of acceleration and braking, with no constant-speed coasting phase. 

### Key Points:
- The `t_total` calculation is only valid when the train never reaches the maximum speed.
- The formula simplifies the process by treating the acceleration and braking phases together, assuming symmetrical motion. The distance is split between the acceleration and braking phases.
